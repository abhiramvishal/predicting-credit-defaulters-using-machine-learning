# predicting-credit-defaulters-using-machine-learning
Banking Industry always needs a more accurate predictive modeling system for predicting the sanction of loans and credit defaulters.
We use different machine learning techniques and data mining algorithms for assignment of loans and finding credit defaulters at most accuracy. 
The objective is implemented using python. The model of rendered to check the eligibility of the customer basing on the loan amount, income and few other details by using random forest algorithm, where the algorithm is used to derive the essential features which tend to decide the credit risk of the individual and further, the algorithm is used to classify the person would defaulter or not from the given input. Then the  amount to be sanctioned is measured by using multivariate linear regression.
